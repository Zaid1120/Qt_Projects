These are a collection of Qt projects.

The purpose of this is to familiarise with PyQt (and other Qt toolkits) and refresh app engineering skills (plus, it's fun). Qt Designer was used for some apps, while other apps' GUIs were coded.

Each project folder has a readme file, which contains images showing the apps in action.
